Universal Chroma Key Shader provides you a simple shader to achieve the chroma key compositing effect on any texture, including movie texture.

It makes transparent the selected color of your texture (image, video or webcam capture), so you can remove easily the background. 

Then you can place any other content behind or in front, also using the shader or not, so you can get your desired composition.

Examples of uses:
-Removing the background of a video to simulate another background
-Get textures with transparency using JPG files instead of bigger PNGs with alpha
-Create 3D effects overlaying videos on different and moving the camera.

Features:
-You can select the color to be removed (most used is green, but any one could be assigned).
-You can control the color tolerance, to remove similar colors too.
-You can control the strength of the cut off.
-You can change this values on runtime
-You can use the shader multiple times in the same scene

USAGE:
-Drag the shader to the material you want to use on
-Enter or pick the color to make the chroma key
-Tune the bars to get the best out of the shader for each case!
